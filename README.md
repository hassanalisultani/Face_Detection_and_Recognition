### Face_Detection_and_Recognition usnig python library 'opencv'
#### In the 'Basic' folder, we have basic functions of opencv.
#### In the 'Advanced' folder, we have some advanced features of open cv library. Like converting the image colors, find edges with different techniques etc.
#### In the 'Detection_Recognition' folder, we have done the face detection in 'face_detect.py' file using 'haar cascasde' method.
#### While in 'face_train.py' file, we trained the model and save it as 'face_trained.yml' file with some images present in 'Face/train' folder.
#### In the last step, from 'face_recognintion.py' file we predict the image of the person using images presesnt in 'Face/val' folder.
#### We have some data in 'Photos' and 'Videos' for practicing the basic and advanced functions.
